# Mountainbike & Politics: Election Guide for the Canton of Zug

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Mountainbike & Politics project. This
platform was created to support better bike policies in the Canton of Zug by
providing a transparent comparison of candidates' positions on mountain biking
ahead of the National and Council of States elections in 2023.

## Project Overview

Our goal is to offer a decision-making aid to mountain biking enthusiasts and
other interested individuals, helping them to make informed voting decisions.
The platform presents candidates' positions based on responses to an online
questionnaire with eight questions. Participation was voluntary, and the
results were published at the end of September 2023.

## About Us

We are a dedicated group of mountain bike enthusiasts who are passionate about
promoting and enhancing the mountain biking experience in Zug. Our goal is to
advocate for the interests of mountain bikers, improve bike infrastructure, and
create exciting opportunities for riders of all ages and skill levels.
